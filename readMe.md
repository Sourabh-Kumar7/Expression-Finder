# Expression Finder

## Overview:
	This project creates a java application where user can submit the stream of input and desire output for which we will try to obtain a valid arithmetic expression.
	
## Problem Statement
	Create an application to process the given unique stream of input and a result given by user and return the valid arithmetic expresstion.
	
## Solution:
	Environment:
		IDE : NetBeans 8.2 configured with JDK 8 
		
	Open the Project in NetBeans IDE and run.
	
	It contains:
	
		Jframe : 
			It is used to provide application user interface.
			
			Input field:
				1] For unique input stream
				2] For desired result
				
			Buttons:
				1]Find Expression:
					This will show a valid arithmetic expression if exists otherwise give "NOT FOUND".
				2]Clear:
					This will clear out all the input and output boxes.
			Output Area:
				A simple Text Field to show the output. 
			
		
		Operator Finder:
		    This is the main class.
			In this I have used four arithmetic operator in order to create a valid arithmetic expression.
			Used arithmetic operators are [+,-,*,/].
			
		Command to Run the application: F6
		    
			
	
## Testing

    Junit:
        It is used for testing the application.
        In this you can add more cases if you want.
        Testing Class Name: OperatorFinderTest
        
    Command for test: Alt+F6
